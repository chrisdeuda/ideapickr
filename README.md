# ideapickr
Ideapickr is Web application that Randomly pick topics from your awesome list of idea for your daily writing habit.

## Origin of idea

When you've been writing and creating content consistently. You really need to ask yourself what you should write about on a daily basis. This is my always dilemma when I've started writing every day.

I’ve come up with this idea last January when I start my daily writing practice in 200wordsaday.com. As I’ve gone with my writing habit, the actual writing itself was a little bit easy as you do it every day.



## 🤔 The Problem:

The hard part is having the motivations to write when you don’t feel like writing and the other thing is what I should write about.

I'm having a hard time thinking and deciding what I should be writing about, even though I have a lot of awesome topic idea on my list. Plus, I’ve got confused about what I should be writing about. The time that spent on thinking could be spent on actually writing.

I would like it to automatically present the topics to me rather than me going through my list.<br>


##  🧰 The solution:<br>



I've checked online if there are available writing prompts generator but it was too focused on writing fictions. I want something that will go through my own list and just randomly pick topics for me and I just press the next button if I didn’t like the currently selected topics.

This eliminates the manual process of going through your list.

## 👨🏻‍💻On development: 

This appilication was originally created with "No-Code" Tools called Coda as an entry for Makers Festival of Product Hunt. But I've decided to create an actual web application using Laravel and VueJS.
